# Anaconda Data Science Expo 2023

> **Achievement:**  
> 1st Place Overall & $7,000 USD

This competition was organized by Anaconda, the world's most popular data science platform. It was held at National University of Singapore (NUS), where both [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) from the United States and [AI Singapore](https://aisingapore.org/) jointly carried out 2 rounds of judging. 

# Overview 
I have used Jupyter Notebook, a web-based computing platform, to code and generate a total of 9 charts to compete under the data visualization category of this competition. This repository contains my finalized codes for a total of 8 charts shown in the poster below:

# Datasets
Refer to the `Datasets` folder to download the following datasets:
* social_progress_dataset
* DataForTable2.1WHR2023 
* undesa_destination_and_origin_processed 
* hapiness_report_2022 
* Regions  

# Installation
To install the required Python libraries/packages in your Jupyter Notebook, run:
```
!pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy numpy plotly geopandas
```
This will install the following libraries along with their dependencies:

`Pandas`: An open-source data analysis and manipulation tool  
`Matplotlib`: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python   
`Seaborn`: A statistical data visualization library built on top of matplotlib  
`Scipy`: An open-source Python library used for scientific and technical computing  
`Numpy`: The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python  
`Plotly`: An interactive graphing library for Python  
`Geopandas`: An open-source project that makes working with geospatial data in python easier
